# JSON API Module

[Has been committed to the development branch of Drupal 8.](https://www.drupal.org/blog/jsonapi-lands-in-drupal-core)


JSON:API is entirely entity-based. That is, it can't process business rules or do things which can't be thought of as "CRUD". Business logic, like registering a new account, logging in a user, or requesting a new password are not part of JSON:API. Many of these are already provided by Drupal core.

JSON:API provides a "link" object at the top level, which links to other "resources", which is a `response document`, which is the response body.

# Gatsby.js

Gatsby is a static-site builder. It takes a data source, queries it using graphql if necessary, and builds a static site.

Some advantages of JAMstack in general:
- No database
- Better performance - doesn't build pages on the fly
- Cheap hosting/scaling

# Gatsby and graphql

Most people run GraphQL on a server to respond live to requests for data from clients. You define a schema (a schema is a formal way of describing the shape of your data) for your GraphQL server and then your GraphQL resolvers retrieve data from databases and/or other APIs.

Gatsby uses GraphQL at build-time and not for live sites. This is unique, and it means you don’t need to run additional services (e.g. a database and Node.js service) to use GraphQL for production websites.

graphql

http://localhost:8000/___graphql

Query the site title (set in gatsby-config)
```$xslt
  site {
      siteMetadata{
        title
      }
    }
```

## Where does Gatsby’s GraphQL schema come from?
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/querying-with-graphql/

Most usages of GraphQL involve manually creating a GraphQL schema.

With Gatsby, we use plugins which fetch data from different sources. We then use that data to automatically infer a GraphQL schema.

# Gatsby and Drupal

Gatsby uses the `gatsby-source-drupal` plugin to automatically create a GraphQL schema that we query across the app/site.

Looking at the source code, basically the plugin fetches jsonapi.links (the top level object from JSONAPI), then iterates over the collected data and uses Gatsby API to create nodes (objects).

graphql - after hooking up `gatsby-source-drupal`

Query some data from drupal
```$xslt
allNodeArticle {
      edges {
        node {
          body {
            value
          }
          fields {
            hello
          }
        }
      }
    }
```
---

With Gatsby's baked in graphQL functionality, we can easily pull data in to our templates. Queried data is passed as `data` to each component's `props`.

```jsx
export default ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>About {data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>
    <p>We're a very cool website you should return to often.</p>
  </div>
)

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
` 
```

# Conclusions

- For UI, using as a complement rather than the driving force of the project is a likely use case.

- A large amount of data could be static, but dynamic data would need typical JS implementation.

- Otherwise a build/deploy CI process for which there are many options.
